    <p class="bigPar"><h2>Dear Sir/Madam,</h2></p>
	<p class="bigPar"> I want to express my big interest in working for the position of a Java  Developer. I have been working with Java Web Development for the last five years, and I graduated in Computer Science in a renowned institution in Brazil. I already have a permanent resident visa. </p>
	<p class="bigPar"> I would be glad to join your selective process, because I truly believe I would fit perfectly. I am a confident and experienced programmer, passionate about doing good code. I love to be part of a good team, I am very commited with the results, ethical and I always make my best to find a good solution for any problem. I am very communicative, easy going, open mind and assertive as well. </p>
	<p class="bigPar"> In my resume you will notice that my experience is large and I have worked with a lot of different technologies, specifications and frameworks (JPA, Hibernate, JSP, JSF, Spring, JavaScript, JQuery, Tomcat, Oracle, MS SQL server). Furthermore, I am a Sun Certified Java Programmer 1.6. </p>
	<p class="bigPar"> For the last three years, I leaded a team of three developers. We were doing softwares to improve the manufactoring process of the of the biggest computer manufactoring in Brazil (also it is the 10th biggest in the world). Our current product set has about 50 different softwares, developed for both linux and windows( bash script, C++, .NET) and Java Web. I managed to convert the project from waterfall cycle to agile, as I realised that would fit better the client needs - these experience went so good (both for us and for the client) that it affected the way the other projects in the company were managed. The project is still active. </p>
	<p class="bigPar"> You can check the recommendations in my linkedin as well. </p>
	<p class="bigPar" style="display: none"> Coragem, mente aberta, liderança, prestativa (gosta de ajudar). Adora diversidade e um bom argumento. Gosta de problemas de computação e etc. </p>
 
	<p class="bigPar label">Yours faithfully,</p>
